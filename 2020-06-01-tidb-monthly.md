## Blog posts

Nick Cameron has written [Large Transactions in TiDB](https://pingcap.com/blog/large-transactions-in-tidb/) that describes how we implemented support for large transactions.

Fei Yang's article [TiCDC: Replication Latency in Milliseconds for 100+ TB Clusters](https://pingcap.com/blog/replication-latency-in-milliseconds-for-100-tb-clusters/) dives deep into why we built TiCDC and how we implement its key features.

In [TiDB Dashboard: Easier Troubleshooting for Distributed Databases](https://pingcap.com/blog/easier-troubleshooting-for-distributed-databases/), Wenxuan Shi, Ming Zhang, and Shuang Chen walks you through the dashboards's main widgets: Key Visualizer, SQL statement analysis, slow query viewing, cluster diagnostics, log search, and instance profiling.
