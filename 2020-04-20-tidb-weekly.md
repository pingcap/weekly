# TiDB Weekly

## News & blog post

Last week, we published a post that shares how we use [Backup & Restore (BR)](https://github.com/pingcap/br), a distributed backup and restore tool (that offers high backup and restore speedsâ€”1 GB/s or more for 10 TB of data) to improve backup and restore speeds for large-scale TiDB clusters. If you specialize in database development, this post might inspire your backup and restore design work. If your application deals with huge amounts of data and you also attach great importance to data security and the efficiency of backup and restore, you can try TiDB with BR.

The full article is here:
