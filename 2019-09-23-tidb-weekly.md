# TiDB Weekly

## News & blog post

Jepsen is a project to analyze distributed systems under stress and to understand if concurrency problems are going to manifest, not only in applications but in databases and queues. It occupies a particular niche of the correctness testing landscape.

Last week, we published an article that introduces why Jepsen is important to the distributed database industry, how it works, common issues found, how we use Jepsen with TiDB, and a short summary of all problems Jepsen has found.

The full article is here:
