## Blog posts

Siddon Tang, the Chief Architect at PingCAP, in his article [TiDB 4.0 GA, Gearing You Up for an Unpredictable World with a Real-Time HTAP Database](https://pingcap.com/blog/tidb-4.0-ga-gearing-you-up-for-an-unpredictable-world-with-real-time-htap-database) announces that TiDB 4.0 has reached general availability (GA).

In [Announcing TiDB as a Service, Fully-Managed TiDB Offering](https://pingcap.com/blog/announcing-tidb-as-a-service-fully-managed-tidb-offering), we are thrilled to announce the beta release of TiDB Cloud, the fully-managed TiDB service delivered by PingCAP.

[VLDB 2020: TiDB, A Raft-based HTAP Database](https://pingcap.com/blog/vldb-2020-tidb-a-raft-based-htap-database) introduces how we will contribute our novel ideas on databases and distributed systems back to the academic community.

Wei Liu's article [How We Improved TPC-C Performance by 50% and TPC-H Performance by 100%](https://pingcap.com/blog/how-we-improved-tpcc-performance-50-percent-and-tpch-performance-100-percent) shows you how we significantly enhanced TiDB 4.0's TPC-C and TPC-H performance.

Brian Anderson has written [Rust's Huge Compilation Units](https://pingcap.com/blog/rust-huge-compilation-units) and [Generics and Compile-Time in Rust](https://pingcap.com/blog/generics-and-compile-time-in-rust) to explore Rust's compile times within the context of TiKV, the key-value store behind the TiDB database.
