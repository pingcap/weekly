In [PingCAP Successfully Completes SOC 2 Type 1 Examination for TiDB Cloud](https://pingcap.com/blog/pingcap-successfully-completes-soc-2-type-1-examination-for-tidb-cloud/), we announced that we have successfully completed a Type 1 System and Organization Controls (SOC) 2 examination for our flagship managed service, TiDB Cloud.

In [Announcing PD Transfer to TiKV Project](https://pingcap.com/blog/announcing-pd-transfer-to-tikv-project/), we announced that we decided to move the PD library entirely to TiKV org, happening at 11 AM, UTC+8, August 17, 2020.

[Create a Scale-Out Hive Cluster with a Distributed, MySQL-Compatible Database](https://pingcap.com/blog/create-scale-out-hive-cluster-with-distributed-mysql-compatible-database/), written by Mengyu Hu, the platform engineer at Zhihu, shared with you how to create a Hive cluster with TiDB as the Metastore database at the backend so that you can use TiDB to horizontally scale Hive Metastore without worrying about database capacity.

In [Why We Chose a Distributed SQL Database to Complement MySQL](https://pingcap.com/case-studies/why-we-chose-a-distributed-sql-database-to-complement-mysql), Chao Xu, the Senior DBA Engineer at VIPKid, discussed how they used TiDB to do multi-dimensional queries on sharded data and enhance their real-time analytics capability.

Ben Ye and Chengwen Yin wrote an article [Building an Automated Testing Framework Based on Chaos MeshÂ® and Argo](https://pingcap.com/blog/building-automated-testing-framework-based-on-chaos-mesh-and-argo/) that described how they used TiPocket, an automated testing framework to build a full Chaos Engineering testing loop for TiDB.

This June, we announced the beta release of TiDB Cloud, the fully managed database service provided by PingCAP. In the article [TiDB Cloud: Managed SQL at Scale on AWS and GCP](https://pingcap.com/blog/tidb-cloud-managed-sql-at-scale-on-aws-and-gcp/), Ken Liu walked you through what TiDB Cloud offers.
